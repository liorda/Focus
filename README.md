Simple clock popup window

## TODO
DONE - 1. fix high dpi to avoid scaling
2. "about" popup with version number
3. fix flickering
4. \r\n instead of \n in log
5. explicitely call "notepad.exe log.tmp" instead of just shell execute "log.tmp"
6. end of day summary
7. better performance: update and draw once a second
